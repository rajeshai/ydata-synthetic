<img src="https://github.com/rajeshai/ydata-synthetic/blob/dev/examples/regular/streamlit%20app/app.JPG" alt="streamlit app to generate synthetic data">

This application takes a pre-processed dataset as input and outputs a synthetic dataset based on the given input parameters. This is made with open source libraries streamlit, ydata-synthetic and deployed on the streamlit cloud.

## How to use

- Upload a pre-processed dataset.
- Choose the numerical features and categorical features.
- Choose all the training parameters appropriately.
- Click the 'click here to start the training process' button.

Wait for the training to end. You will see a graph comparing the original data and synthetic data after training.
Please use less number of epochs to complete the training process quickly as this application is deployed on the community cloud of streamlit which has computational limits.
